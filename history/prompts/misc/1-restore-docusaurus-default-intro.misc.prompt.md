## Prompt
```text
When you create the chapters of six but in during the creations you deleted the bydefault intro in docusaurus website. it is a compulsary.
```

## Response

I have created a new `index.md` file in `docusaurus-book/docs/`. This should now serve as a default introduction page, which Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebar should pick up.
```
